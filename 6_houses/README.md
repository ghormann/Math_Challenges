Six houses are in a circle.   The circle is 27 miles long
Assign the distances between houses so that the the 30 distances between 
the houses (A->B, A->C, etc.) use at least 1-26 at least once. (OK to use some numbers twice)

Note: A->C is different than C->A.  Distances always go clockwise around the circle
